    <h2>Why do we include an Oral History Meta data Registry to the transcription chain?</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on the context of how an interview is created, as part of a collection that is kept in an archive, 
      or as research material for an individual researcher, a number of characteristics will have been attributed
       to the recording, we call that 'meta-data'. In the first case, the archival context, attributing meta-data
       is standard procedure. In the second case, interviewing to publish a PhD thesis or an article, it depends
       on the kind of discipline the scholar is familiarized with whether this is required and whether re-use is
       considered as an option. Meta-data tell us something about who, when, and why the interview was created. 
      If the meta data are created in a systematic way and abide to  a standard, the interviews they refer to 
      become searchable and can be processed with digital tools. The possibilities of digital technology to open 
      up oral history archives and support oral history scholarship, can only be fully exploited if both kind 
      of interview material abide to the principle of metadata. This is why we encourage both kind of scholars, 
      librarians/archivists as well as historians, anthropologists, linguists and sociologists, to attribute 
      meta-data to their interviews and to abide to a standard.

      The Radboud University Oral History Metadata Registry provides such a standard. For the material that you 
      have processed in our oral history assembly line, we offer an interface to list, correct and add metadata 
      specifications for your Oral History recordings. Each OH metadata item contains information that refers to 
      administrative issues – ID number, time, length, creator etc, and descriptive information that refers to 
      the content, what is the subject and who are the speakers. There are many meta data standards, with each 
      have their advantages and disadvantages. The standard that we abide to comes from the disciplinary field 
      of linguistics and is called  Clarin Component Registry.
